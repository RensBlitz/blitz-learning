# Control Flow Exercises

This directory contains a series of exercises to help you understand and practice control flow concepts in Java.

## How to Run the Exercises in IntelliJ

**The only thing you need to do is mark the `exercises` folder as a source root in IntelliJ.**

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. In the Project view, right-click the `exercises` folder.
3. Select "Mark Directory as" â†’ "Sources Root".
4. Open any exercise file (e.g., `IfElseStatements.java`).
5. Click the green "Run" arrow next to the `main` method or at the top of the file to run the exercise.

That's it! You do not need to use the command line or Maven for these exercises.

## Exercise Overview

1. **IfElseStatements.java**: Practice with if-else conditional statements to make decisions in code.
2. **ForLoops.java**: Use for loops to iterate through sequences and arrays.
3. **WhileLoops.java**: Use while and do-while loops to iterate based on conditions.
4. **SwitchStatements.java**: Learn to use switch statements for multi-branch decision making.
5. **TernaryOperator.java**: Use the ternary operator for compact conditional expressions.
6. **BreakAndContinue.java**: Control loop flow with break and continue statements.
7. **NestedControlStructures.java**: Combine multiple control flow structures (nested loops and conditionals).
8. **GuardClauses.java**: Implement early returns and guard clauses for cleaner code.

## Tips

- Each exercise file contains detailed comments explaining what you need to implement.
- Look for the `TODO` comments in each file to identify what you need to complete.
- The assertion tests will help you verify if your implementation is correct.
- If an assertion fails, the error message will give you a hint about what's wrong.
