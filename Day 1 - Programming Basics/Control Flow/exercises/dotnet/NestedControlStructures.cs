/// Exercise 6: Nested Control Structures
/// 
/// This exercise focuses on using nested loops and conditionals to solve more complex problems.
/// 
/// Learning objectives:
/// - Understand how to use nested loops effectively
/// - Learn to combine different control structures
/// - Practice writing clean, readable nested control structures
