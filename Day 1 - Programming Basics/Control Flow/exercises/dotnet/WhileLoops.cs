/// Exercise 3: While Loops
/// 
/// This exercise focuses on using while loops and do-while loops to perform iterations based on conditions.
/// 
/// Learning objectives:
/// - Understand the difference between while and do-while loops
/// - Learn when to use while loops instead of for loops
/// - Practice using loop control variables effectively
