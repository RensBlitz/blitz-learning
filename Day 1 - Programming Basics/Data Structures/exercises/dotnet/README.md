   - Performing calculations (sum, max, min, average)
   - Array reversal and manipulation

2. **ListOperations.cs**: Dynamic list operations using `List<T>`
   - Creating and initializing lists
   - Adding, updating, and removing elements
   - Searching and sorting operations

3. **StackAndQueue.cs**: Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) structures
   - Understanding push/pop operations for stacks
   - Understanding enqueue/dequeue operations for queues
   - Practical applications (string reversal, palindrome checking)

4. **DictionaryOperations.cs**: Key-value collections using `Dictionary<K,V>`
   - Creating and manipulating dictionaries
   - Fast key-based lookups and updates
   - Practical applications (word frequency counting)

5. **SetOperations.cs**: Unique element collections using `HashSet<T>`
   - Working with sets for unique elements
   - Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
   - Understanding when to use sets vs other collections

6. **CollectionIteration.cs**: Various iteration techniques
   - Traditional for loops vs foreach loops

   - Advanced scenarios (LRU cache implementation)

## Completing the Exercises ‚úÖ

Each exercise consists of:
- **Implementation file** (.cs): Contains methods with TODO comments for you to implement
- **Test file** (Tests.cs): Contains xUnit tests that validate your solution

Follow these steps for each exercise:

1. Read the file header and method XML documentation comments carefully
2. Locate the TODO comments in the implementation code
3. Implement your solution by completing the methods
4. Run the tests to verify your solution: `dotnet test`
5. When all tests pass, you've successfully completed the exercise!

## Key C# Collections Used üìö

This exercise series introduces you to C#'s core collection types:

- **Arrays** (`int[]`, `string[]`): Fixed-size, indexed collections
- **List&lt;T&gt;** (`List<int>`, `List<string>`): Dynamic arrays that can grow/shrink
- **Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;** (`Dictionary<string, int>`): Key-value pairs for fast lookups
- **HashSet&lt;T&gt;** (`HashSet<string>`): Unordered collections of unique elements
- **Stack&lt;T&gt;** (`Stack<int>`): LIFO (Last In, First Out) collection
- **Queue&lt;T&gt;** (`Queue<string>`): FIFO (First In, First Out) collection

## C# Specific Features üåü

This exercise series also introduces important C# concepts:

- **Generics**: Type-safe collections (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<K,V>`)
- **LINQ**: Language Integrated Query for collection processing
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Using `null!` for placeholders
- **XML Documentation**: Triple-slash comments (`///`)
- **xUnit Testing**: Modern unit testing framework for .NET

## Key Differences from Java üîÑ

If you're coming from Java, note these important differences:

- **Collections**: `List<T>` instead of `ArrayList`, `Dictionary<K,V>` instead of `HashMap`
- **Iteration**: `foreach` instead of enhanced for loops
- **LINQ**: Powerful built-in query capabilities (like Java Streams but more integrated)
- **Naming**: `Count` property instead of `size()` method
- **Testing**: xUnit instead of JUnit/assertions
- **Nullability**: Explicit nullable reference types in modern C#

## Hints and Tips üí°

If you get stuck:
1. Review the relevant concepts in the [DataStructures.md](../../DataStructures.md) file
2. Look at the test failure messages to understand expected results
3. Use IntelliSense in your IDE to explore available methods
4. Check the official documentation: [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)
5. Use the debugger to step through your code

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Index out of bounds**: Remember that C# collections are zero-indexed
- **Null reference exceptions**: Initialize your collections before using them
- **Modifying collections while iterating**: Use `ToList()` or iterate backwards when removing items
- **Case sensitivity**: C# is case-sensitive (`Count` vs `count`)
- **LINQ confusion**: Remember that LINQ methods return new collections, they don't modify the original

## Additional Challenges üåü

After completing the basic exercises, try these additional challenges:

1. Implement a custom generic data structure (e.g., a binary tree)
2. Compare performance of different collection types for various operations
3. Explore thread-safe collections (`ConcurrentDictionary`, etc.)
4. Implement advanced LINQ queries with complex filtering and grouping
5. Create a real-world application using multiple data structures together

## Useful Commands üõ†Ô∏è

```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with detailed output
dotnet test --verbosity normal

# Run tests for a specific class
dotnet test --filter "ArrayBasicsTests"

# Clean and rebuild
dotnet clean && dotnet build

# Create a new console application (for experimentation)
dotnet new console -n MyExperiment
```

## Performance Considerations üìä

As you work through these exercises, consider:

- **Arrays**: Fixed size, very fast access, but can't resize
- **Lists**: Dynamic sizing, slightly slower than arrays, most versatile
- **Dictionaries**: O(1) average lookup time, perfect for key-value scenarios
- **Sets**: O(1) contains checks, automatic duplicate removal
- **Stacks/Queues**: Optimized for specific access patterns

## Feedback and Questions ‚ùì

If you have any questions or need clarification on any exercise, please reach out to your instructor.

This directory contains a series of exercises to help you understand and practice data structure concepts in C#. Each exercise builds upon the previous ones, so it's recommended to complete them in order.
