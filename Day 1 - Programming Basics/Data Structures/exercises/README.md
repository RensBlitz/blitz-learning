# Data Structures Exercises üèóÔ∏è

## Prerequisites ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before attempting these exercises, please read the [DataStructures.md](../DataStructures.md) file to understand the core concepts of data structures in programming.

## Environment Setup üîß

### Required Software
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any Java IDE
- Git (for version control)

### Verifying Your Setup
1. Check your Java version:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   The output should show version 21 or higher.

2. Make sure your IDE is configured to use the correct JDK.

## How to Run the Exercises in IntelliJ

**The only thing you need to do is mark the `exercises` folder as a source root in IntelliJ.**

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. In the Project view, right-click the `exercises` folder.
3. Select **"Mark Directory as" ‚Üí "Sources Root"**.
4. Open any `DataStructuresN.java` file (where N is 1-8).
5. Click the green "Run" arrow next to the `main` method or at the top of the file to run the exercise.

That's it! You do not need to use the command line or Maven for these exercises.

## Exercise Overview üìÇ

This module contains 8 progressively challenging exercises:

1. **DataStructures1.java**: Arrays basics
   - Create, initialize, and manipulate arrays
   - Perform common array operations

2. **DataStructures2.java**: Lists and ArrayLists
   - Work with dynamic Lists using ArrayList
   - Add, remove, and modify list elements

3. **DataStructures3.java**: Stacks and queues
   - Implement stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) operations
   - Understand different access patterns

4. **DataStructures4.java**: Maps and dictionaries
   - Store and retrieve key-value pairs using HashMap
   - Work with keys and values

5. **DataStructures5.java**: Sets
   - Work with unique collections using HashSet
   - Understand set operations

6. **DataStructures6.java**: Iterating collections
   - Traverse collections using different techniques
   - Use for-each loops, iterators, and streams

7. **DataStructures7.java**: Nested collections
   - Work with more complex data structures
   - Create and manipulate nested collections

8. **DataStructures8.java**: Choosing the right data structure
   - Select appropriate data structures for different scenarios
   - Compare performance characteristics

## Completing the Exercises ‚úÖ

Each exercise file contains:
- A detailed description of the problem
- Learning objectives for the exercise
- Methods with TODO comments explaining what you need to implement
- Assertions that automatically validate your solution

Follow these steps for each exercise:

1. Read the file header and method JavaDoc comments carefully
2. Locate the TODO comments in the code
3. Implement your solution by completing the code
4. Run the file with assertions enabled to verify your solution
5. When all assertions pass, you've successfully completed the exercise!

## Tips and Hints üí°

- Each exercise file contains detailed comments explaining what you need to implement.
- Look for the `TODO` comments in each file to identify what you need to complete.
- The assertion tests will help you verify if your implementation is correct.
- If an assertion fails, the error message will give you a hint about what's wrong.
- Java's Collection Framework is powerful - take time to explore the documentation!

## Additional Challenges üåü

After completing the basic exercises, try these additional challenges:

1. Create a custom data structure (like a linked list) from scratch.
2. Implement a priority queue using different approaches.
3. Create a program that uses multiple data structures together to solve a complex problem.
4. Compare the performance of different data structures for specific operations.
