/// PrimitiveTypeDeclaration: Primitive Type Declaration and Initialization
/// 
/// This exercise focuses on declaring and initializing variables of different primitive types in C#.
/// You'll practice using int, double, char, and bool, and understand their default values and assignments.
/// 
/// Learning objectives:
/// - Declare variables of different primitive types (int, double, char, bool)
/// - Initialize variables with appropriate values
/// - Understand default values for primitive types (though not explicitly tested here)
/// - Perform basic assignments
/// </summary>

    /// 1. An integer variable named 'age' with value 30
    /// 2. A double variable named 'price' with value 19.99
    /// 3. A character variable named 'grade' with value 'A'
    /// 4. A boolean variable named 'isActive' with value true
