# Data Types Exercises üß™

## Prerequisites ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before attempting these exercises, please read the [DataTypes.md](../../DataTypes.md) file to understand the core concepts of data types in programming.

## Environment Setup üîß

### Required Software
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any Java IDE
- Git (for version control)

### Verifying Your Setup
1. Check your Java version:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   The output should show version 21 or higher.

2. Make sure your IDE is configured to use the correct JDK.

## How to Run the Exercises in IntelliJ

**The only thing you need to do is mark the `exercises` folder as a source root in IntelliJ.**

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. In the Project view, right-click the `exercises` folder.
3. Select **"Mark Directory as" ‚Üí "Sources Root"**.
4. Open any `DataTypesN.java` file (where N is 1-8).
5. Click the green "Run" arrow next to the `main` method or at the top of the file to run the exercise.

That's it! You do not need to use the command line or Maven for these exercises.

## Exercise Overview üìÇ

This module contains 8 progressively challenging exercises:

1. **DataTypes1.java**: Primitive type declaration and initialization
   - Declare and initialize variables of different primitive types
   - Understand default values and assignments

2. **DataTypes2.java**: Reference type declaration and initialization
   - Work with Strings and arrays
   - Understand reference vs. primitive types

3. **DataTypes3.java**: Type safety and assignment errors
   - Explore what happens when assigning incompatible types
   - Learn about compile-time and runtime errors

4. **DataTypes4.java**: Type conversion (widening and narrowing)
   - Perform implicit and explicit type conversions
   - Handle potential data loss

5. **DataTypes5.java**: String and char operations
   - Manipulate characters and strings
   - Convert between char and String

6. **DataTypes6.java**: Arrays and collections basics
   - Declare, initialize, and use arrays
   - Access and modify array elements

7. **DataTypes7.java**: Constants and immutability
   - Use the `final` keyword for constants
   - Understand immutable types (e.g., String)

8. **DataTypes8.java**: Common pitfalls and best practices
   - Identify and fix common mistakes with data types
   - Apply best practices for type usage

## Completing the Exercises ‚úÖ

Each exercise file contains:
- A detailed description of the problem
- Learning objectives for the exercise
- Methods with TODO comments explaining what you need to implement
- Assertions that automatically validate your solution

Follow these steps for each exercise:

1. Read the file header and method JavaDoc comments carefully
2. Locate the TODO comments in the code
3. Implement your solution by completing the code
4. Run the file with assertions enabled to verify your solution
5. When all assertions pass, you've successfully completed the exercise!

## Tips and Hints üí°

- Each exercise file contains detailed comments explaining what you need to implement.
- Look for the `TODO` comments in each file to identify what you need to complete.
- The assertion tests will help you verify if your implementation is correct.
- If an assertion fails, the error message will give you a hint about what's wrong.
- Experiment with different data types and conversions beyond the exercises!

## Additional Challenges üåü

After completing the basic exercises, try these additional challenges:

1. Write a program that uses all primitive types in a real-world scenario.
2. Create your own class with fields of different data types.
3. Explore Java's wrapper classes and autoboxing/unboxing.
4. Practice working with multidimensional arrays and collections.
