# Methods Exercises

This directory contains a series of exercises to help you understand and practice methods in Java.

## How to Run the Exercises in IntelliJ

**The only thing you need to do is mark the `exercises` folder as a source root in IntelliJ.**

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. In the Project view, right-click the `exercises` folder.
3. Select "Mark Directory as" â†’ "Sources Root".
4. Open any `Methods1.java` through `Methods8.java` file.
5. Click the green "Run" arrow next to the `main` method or at the top of the file to run the exercise.

That's it! You do not need to use the command line or Maven for these exercises.

## Exercise Overview

1. **Methods1**: Method basics - declaration and invocation
   - Create simple methods, pass parameters, and return values
   - Understand method signatures and invocation

2. **Methods2**: Method parameters and return values
   - Work with different parameter types and return values
   - Practice method overloading

3. **Methods3**: Method scope and variable visibility
   - Understand variable scope within methods
   - Use local variables and parameters effectively

4. **Methods4**: Method documentation and good practices
   - Write proper JavaDoc comments for methods
   - Apply method naming conventions and best practices

5. **Methods5**: Method decomposition 
   - Break down complex operations into multiple methods
   - Create helper methods for better organization

6. **Methods6**: Method overloading
   - Create methods with the same name but different parameters
   - Understand how Java resolves method calls with overloaded methods

7. **Methods7**: Variable arguments (varargs)
   - Work with methods that accept variable numbers of arguments
   - Understand varargs limitations and usage patterns

8. **Methods8**: Recursion basics
   - Create and use recursive methods
   - Compare iterative and recursive solutions to problems

## Tips

- Each exercise file contains detailed comments explaining what you need to implement.
- Look for the `TODO` comments in each file to identify what you need to complete.
- The assertion tests will help you verify if your implementation is correct.
- If an assertion fails, the error message will give you a hint about what's wrong.
- Remember that a method's signature includes its name, parameters, and return type.
