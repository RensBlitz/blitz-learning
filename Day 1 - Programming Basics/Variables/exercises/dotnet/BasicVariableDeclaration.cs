/// Exercise 1: Basic Variable Declaration and Initialization
///
/// This exercise focuses on declaring and initializing variables in C#.
/// You'll practice using different value types and understand
/// how to store various types of values.
///
/// Learning objectives:
/// - Declare variables of different value types
/// - Initialize variables with appropriate values
/// - Understand how to use basic data types in C#
///
/// Note: This exercise uses xUnit tests for validation.
/// Run 'dotnet test' to check your implementation.
/// </summary>

    /// 1. An integer variable with value 25
    /// 2. A double-precision floating-point variable with value 98.6
    /// 3. A single character variable with value 'A'
    /// 4. A boolean variable with value false
    ///
    /// Then return these variables in an array in the order specified above.
    ///
    /// Note: The return type is object[] to allow different types in the array.
