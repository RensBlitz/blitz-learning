# Operators Exercises ‚ûï‚ûñ

## Prerequisites ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before attempting these exercises, please read the [Operators.md](../../Operators.md) file to understand the core concepts of operators in programming.

## Environment Setup üîß

### Required Software
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any Java IDE
- Git (for version control)

### Verifying Your Setup
1. Check your Java version:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   The output should show version 21 or higher.

2. Make sure your IDE is configured to use the correct JDK.

## How to Run the Exercises in IntelliJ

**The only thing you need to do is mark the `exercises` folder as a source root in IntelliJ.**

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. In the Project view, right-click the `exercises` folder.
3. Select **"Mark Directory as" ‚Üí "Sources Root"**.
4. Open any `ExerciseN.java` file (where N is 1-5).
5. Click the green "Run" arrow next to the `main` method or at the top of the file to run the exercise.

That's it! You do not need to use the command line or Maven for these exercises.

## Exercise Overview üìÇ

This module contains 5 progressively challenging exercises:

1. **ArithmeticOperators.java**: Basic arithmetic operators
   - Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
   - Understand operator precedence
   - Perform calculations with variables

2. **ComparisonOperators.java**: Comparison and relational operators
   - Use equality and inequality operators
   - Compare numbers and variables
   - Practice boolean expressions

3. **LogicalOperators.java**: Logical operators
   - Use AND, OR, and NOT operators
   - Combine multiple conditions
   - Understand short-circuit evaluation

4. **AssignmentOperators.java**: Assignment and compound operators
   - Use assignment and compound assignment operators (+=, -=, etc.)
   - Update variable values efficiently
   - Practice chaining operations

5. **OperatorBestPractices.java**: Operator pitfalls and best practices
   - Identify and avoid common mistakes (e.g., = vs ==, precedence)
   - Use parentheses for clarity
   - Apply best practices in complex expressions

## Completing the Exercises ‚úÖ

Each exercise file contains:
- A detailed description of the problem
- Learning objectives for the exercise
- Methods with TODO comments explaining what you need to implement
- Assertions that automatically validate your solution

Follow these steps for each exercise:

1. Read the file header and method JavaDoc comments carefully
2. Locate the TODO comments in the code
3. Implement your solution by completing the code
4. Run the file with assertions enabled to verify your solution
5. When all assertions pass, you've successfully completed the exercise!

## Tips and Hints üí°

- Each exercise file contains detailed comments explaining what you need to implement.
- Look for the `TODO` comments in each file to identify what you need to complete.
- The assertion tests will help you verify if your implementation is correct.
- If an assertion fails, the error message will give you a hint about what's wrong.
- Experiment with different operators and combinations beyond the exercises!

## Additional Challenges üåü

After completing the basic exercises, try these additional challenges:

1. Write a program that uses all arithmetic and logical operators in a real-world scenario.
2. Create your own operator precedence puzzles.
3. Explore bitwise operators and their applications.
4. Practice writing complex boolean expressions for decision making.
