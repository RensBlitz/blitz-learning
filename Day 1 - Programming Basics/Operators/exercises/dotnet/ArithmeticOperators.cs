/// Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic Operators
///
/// Scenario: You're building a calculator application that needs to perform
/// basic arithmetic operations. Users will input two numbers and expect
/// various calculations to be performed.
///
/// Learning objectives:
/// - Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
/// - Perform calculations with variables
/// - Understand operator precedence
/// - Handle edge cases in arithmetic operations
/// </summary>

    /// Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.
    /// 
    /// Requirements:
    /// - Input: two integers a and b
    /// - Output must be an array containing in this order:
    ///   - Sum of a and b
    ///   - Difference of a and b
    ///   - Product of a and b
    ///   - Integer division of a by b
    ///   - Remainder of a divided by b

    /// <param name="b">second integer operand</param>
    /// <returns>array containing the results of various calculations</returns>
