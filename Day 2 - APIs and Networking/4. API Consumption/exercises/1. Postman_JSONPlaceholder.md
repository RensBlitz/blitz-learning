# Exercise: Using Postman with JSONPlaceholder API üöÄ

## Overview
In this exercise, you'll learn how to use Postman to interact with REST APIs using the JSONPlaceholder API, a free fake API for testing and prototyping.

## Prerequisites
1. Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. No API key needed - JSONPlaceholder is free and open

## Base URL
```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```

## Exercises

### 1. GET Requests üì•

#### 1.1 Fetch All Posts
1. Open Postman
2. Create a new request:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
3. Send the request
4. Observe the JSON response structure

#### 1.2 Fetch Single Post
1. Create another request:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`
2. Compare the response with the previous one
3. Try different post IDs (1-100)

#### 1.3 Fetch Comments for a Post
1. Create a request:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments`
2. Observe how nested resources work

### 2. POST Request üì§

#### 2.1 Create a New Post
1. Create a new request:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
   - Headers:
     ```
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```
   - Body (raw JSON):
     ```json
     {
       "title": "My New Post",
       "body": "This is the content of my post",
       "userId": 1
     }
     ```
2. Send the request
3. Observe the response - note the assigned ID

### 3. PUT and PATCH üîÑ

#### 3.1 Update Post (PUT)
1. Create a request:
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "title": "Updated Title",
       "body": "Updated content",
       "userId": 1
     }
     ```
2. Note how PUT requires the complete resource

#### 3.2 Partial Update (PATCH)
1. Create a request:
   - Method: PATCH
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "title": "Only Update Title"
     }
     ```
2. Note how PATCH allows partial updates

### 4. DELETE Request ‚ùå

1. Create a request:
   - Method: DELETE
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`
2. Observe the response status

### 5. Working with Query Parameters üîç

1. Create a request to filter posts:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1`
2. Try different query parameters:
   - `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=1`
   - `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1&id=2`

## Challenges üéØ

1. **Collection Creation**
   - Create a Postman collection named "JSONPlaceholder"
   - Add all the above requests to it
   - Use folders to organize by request type

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Create an environment in Postman
   - Add a variable for the base URL
   - Update your requests to use the variable

3. **Request Chaining**
   - Create a post using POST
   - Use the returned ID to fetch the post
   - Update the post
   - Delete the post

4. **Error Handling**
   - Try to fetch a non-existent post (e.g., ID: 999)
   - Try to create a post with invalid data
   - Observe how the API handles errors

## Tips üí°
- Use the Postman console to see detailed request/response information
- Save your requests as you go
- Try to understand the relationship between different endpoints
- Pay attention to status codes and response headers

## Expected Learning Outcomes üéì
After completing this exercise, you should:
- Understand how to use Postman for API testing
- Know how to send different types of HTTP requests
- Understand request/response structures
- Be able to work with query parameters
- Know how to organize requests in Postman
- Understand basic API error handling
