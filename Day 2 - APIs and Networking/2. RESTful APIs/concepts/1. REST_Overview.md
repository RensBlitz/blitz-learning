# Understanding RESTful APIs: A Complete Guide üîÑ

## What is REST? ü§î

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Think of it as a set of rules for how your API should behave:
- Like a well-organized library where every book has its place
- Each resource (book) has a unique address (URL)
- You can interact with resources using standard methods (HTTP verbs)

## Core Principles of REST üìö

### 1. Client-Server Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**
  - Client (Frontend) handles user interface and user experience
  - Server (Backend) handles data storage and business logic
  ```
  Client (Web/Mobile)  ‚Üê‚Üí  Server (API)  ‚Üê‚Üí  Database
  ```

### 2. Statelessness
- Each request must contain ALL information needed
- Server doesn't store client session info
- Like ordering at a restaurant:
  ```
  BAD (Stateful):
  "I'll have the usual" (Server needs to remember your usual)

  GOOD (Stateless):
  "I'll have a Special Burger with extra pickles" (Complete information)
  ```

### 3. Cacheability
- Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not
- Like a coffee shop's menu:
  ```
  Cacheable:
  - Menu items (rarely change)
  - Store locations
  
  Non-cacheable:
  - Daily specials
  - Current order status
  ```

### 4. Uniform Interface
Four key principles:
1. **Resource Identification**
   ```
   Good: /users/123
   Bad:  /get-user-by-id?id=123
   ```

2. **Resource Manipulation through Representations**
   ```json
   GET /users/123
   {
     "id": 123,
     "name": "McLovin",
     "profile": "/users/123/profile"
   }
   ```

3. **Self-Descriptive Messages**
   ```http
   POST /orders
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer abc123

   {
     "productId": "456",
     "quantity": 2
   }
   ```

## Resource Naming Best Practices üìù

### 1. Use Nouns for Resources
```
GOOD:
GET /articles
GET /users
GET /products

BAD:
GET /getArticles
GET /createUser
GET /updateProduct
```

### 2. Collection/Item Pattern
```
Collection: /users
Item:       /users/123

Collection: /users/123/orders
Item:       /users/123/orders/456
```

### 3. Consistent Pluralization
```
GOOD:
/users
/users/123
/users/123/orders

BAD (mixing singular/plural):
/user
/users/123
/userOrders
```

### 4. Resource Relationships
```
GOOD:
GET /users/123/orders        (all orders for user 123)
GET /orders/456/items        (all items in order 456)
GET /users/123/orders/456    (specific order 456 for user 123)

BAD:
GET /users/123/getOrders
GET /getOrderItemsById/456
```

## HTTP Methods in REST üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. GET - Read
```http
GET /users/123
GET /users?role=admin
GET /users/123/orders
```

### 2. POST - Create
```http
POST /users
{
  "name": "Mohammed",
  "email": "mohammed@example.com"
}
```

### 3. PUT - Update (Full)
```http
PUT /users/123
{
  "name": "Mohammed",
  "email": "mohammed@example.com",
  "role": "customer"
}
```

### 4. PATCH - Update (Partial)
```http
PATCH /users/123
{
  "email": "mohammed.new@example.com"
}
```

### 5. DELETE - Remove
```http
DELETE /users/123
```

## API Versioning Strategies üìä

### 1. URL Versioning
```
/api/v1/users
/api/v2/users
```

### 2. Header Versioning
```http
Accept: application/vnd.company.api+json;version=1
```

### 3. Query Parameter
```
/api/users?version=1
```

## Common REST Anti-Patterns to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Breaking Resource Naming Conventions
```
BAD:
/getUserDetails/123
/createNewOrder
/updateUserData

GOOD:
/users/123
POST /orders
PUT /users/123
```

### 2. Ignoring HTTP Methods
```
BAD:
POST /articles/deleteArticle/123
GET /articles/createNew

GOOD:
DELETE /articles/123
POST /articles
```

### 3. Not Using Status Codes Properly
```
BAD:
200 OK (for everything)

GOOD:
201 Created (POST success)
204 No Content (DELETE success)
400 Bad Request (validation error)
404 Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
```

### 4. Exposing Database Operations
```
BAD:
/api/runQuery
/api/joinTables

GOOD:
/api/orders?status=pending&sort=date
```

## Best Practices Summary üåü

1. **Use Nouns for Resources**
   - Resources are things, not actions

2. **Keep it Simple**
   - Don't overcomplicate URLs
   - Use clear, meaningful names

3. **Be Consistent**
   - In naming
   - In response formats
   - In error handling

4. **Use HTTP Methods Properly**
   - GET for reading
   - POST for creating
   - PUT/PATCH for updating
   - DELETE for removing

5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Use appropriate status codes
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Include error details when needed

6. **Document Your API**
   - Use OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Include examples
   - Keep documentation updated
